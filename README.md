## rjgtoys: A collection of projects and ideas

This is a collection of projects that has built up over several years.

I do them to explore ideas, learn about new technologies, or simply to
'keep my hand in'.

Here is a list of what you'll find here:

### [projects](../../../rjgtoys-projects)

A thin layer on top of `setuptools` to simplify writing Python projects.

### [xc](../../../rjgtoys-xc)

Structured exceptions for Python.  Easy to declare and to handle, and also good in Web APIs.
