rjgtoys: A collection of projects and ideas
===========================================

This is a collection of projects that has built up over several years.

I do them to explore ideas, learn about new technologies, or simply to
'keep my hand in'.

Here is a list of what you'll find here:

projects_
---------

A thin layer on top of `setuptools` to simplify writing Python projects.

tkthread_
---------

Allows threads to interact with tkinter_ applications.

xc_
---

Structured exceptions for Python.  Easy to declare and to handle, and also good in Web APIs.

config_
-------

A modular configuration data interface built using pydantic_.

cli_
----

Command-line tool components built on top of the Python argparse_ library module.

yaml_
-----

A thin layer on top of ruamel.yaml_ that does YAML I/O with some tricks
that I find useful.

thing_
------

A kind of ``dict`` that behaves a bit like a JavaScript object, so ``x['a']`` and ``x.a`` are equivalent.
