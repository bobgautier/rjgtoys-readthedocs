rjgtoys: A collection of projects and ideas
===========================================

This is a collection of projects that has built up over several years.

I do them to explore ideas, learn about new technologies, or simply to
'keep my hand in'.

Here is a list of what you'll find here:

projects_
---------

A thin layer on top of :mod:`setuptools` to simplify writing Python projects.

xc_
---

Structured exceptions for Python.  Easy to declare and to handle, and also good in Web APIs.

.. _projects: /projects/projects/

.. _xc: /projects/xc/
